# Multi-Model Equity Signal Research & Alpha Ablation (S&P 500)

This repo implements an end-to-end **equity signal research pipeline** on an S&P 500 universe:

- raw prices → factor panel → `1-day` forward-return labels  
- model zoo: **IC-weighted linear baseline**, **MLP**, **XGBoost**, **Transformer**  
- cost-aware long–short backtest with Sharpe / total return / max drawdown / turnover  
- hooks for robustness tests, alpha ablation, and **RL / graph-based** extensions

The core question:

> Given a fixed factor set and cost model, **how much edge does each model really have**, and how does that edge behave once you include turnover and drawdowns?

---

## 1. Data & experiment setup

- **Universe:** S&P 500 constituents (Kaggle dataset)
- **Frequency:** daily bars
- **Date range:** 2016-01-01 – 2026-01-16
- **Label:** `1-day` forward return, stored as `fwd_ret`
- **Split (time-based):**
  - Train / validation: **2016-01-01 – 2021-12-31**
  - Out-of-sample (OOS): **2022-01-01 – 2026-01-16**

The time split is controlled by `config.yaml`:

The main modeling scripts expect a single panel CSV with at least:
	•	date (timestamp)
	•	ticker (equity identifier)
	•	close (closing price)
	•	factor columns from features.list
	•	fwd_ret (forward return label)

## 2. First experiment results

### Out-of-sample performance (2022–2026, after costs)

| Model        | Sharpe | Total Return | Max Drawdown | Avg Turnover |
| :----------- | -----: | -----------: | -----------: | -----------: |
| Linear       | 0.2908 | +17.84%      | −36.29%      | 60.1%        |
| MLP          | 0.0716 | −2.32%       | −25.27%      | 0.0%         |
| Transformer  | 0.3228 | +20.86%      | −35.18%      | 141.4%       |
| **XGBoost ⭐** | **0.4796** | **+53.50%** | −46.25%      | 99.31%       |

> 🟢 **Best risk/return trade-off:** XGBoost.  
> 🔴 **Failed baseline:** MLP (negative OOS return and essentially zero turnover).

Interpretation: 
- Tree-based XGBoost is the clear winner on this factor set:
- Highest Sharpe and total return, despite a relatively high turnover.
- Transformer beats linear but does not beat XGBoost, and trades even more (turnover ≈ 141%).
- MLP collapsed:
	- Negative OOS return and essentially zero turnover — more a sign of training/regularization issues than alpha.
- Turnover and costs are first-order effects:
	- Naively comparing raw returns would miss how sensitive some models are to trading frictions.

## 3. Models

All models follow the same basic pattern:
1. Load the panel from `data_path` (CSV with factors + `fwd_ret`)
2. Convert `date` to `datetime`.
3. Split into **train** (`date < train_split_date`) and **test/OOS** (`date ≥ train_split_date`).
4. Train on the **train** window only.
5. Write out OOS `score` and realized `fwd_ret` for each `(date, ticker)`.

### 3.1 IC-weighted linear baseline

Implementation: run_linear_baseline(data_path, output_path)

File: typically src/models_linear.py (or wherever you put the function).

Logic:
- Uses config['features']['list'] as the factor set.
- Uses config['models']['train_split_date'] to define train vs test.

Training:
1. Compute daily cross-sectional IC (Spearman rank correlation between each factor and fwd_ret) on the train sample:
2. Stack the mean ICs into a weight vector w (one weight per factor).
3. On the test sample, compute a composite linear score:

Output:
- output_path CSV with columns ['date', 'ticker', 'close', 'score', 'fwd_ret'].

Interpretation:
- This is not a generic regression; it’s an IC-weighted factor portfolio.

### 3.2 MLP

Implementation: run_mlp_model(data_path, output_path)

Pipeline:
1. Read CSV, parse date.
2. Train = date < train_split_date, Test = date ≥ train_split_date.
3. Features = config['features']['list'], label = config['features']['label'] (usually fwd_ret).
4. Standardize features with StandardScaler fitted on train only.
5. Train with MSE loss and Adam optimizer for mlp_cfg['epochs'].
6. Predict OOS scores on the test set and write to CSV.

This is a pure cross-sectional MLP: each (date, ticker) row is treated independently.

### 3.3 Transformer (degenerate 1-step TS encoder)

Implementation: run_transformer_model(data_path, output_path)

Model class: TS_Transformer
- Embeds factor vector → d_model
- Passes through a nn.TransformerEncoder with n_layers and n_heads
- Takes the last time step and maps to a scalar via fc

So this Transformer is effectively a fancy nonlinear map on the factor vector, not a true multi-step time-series model. That’s fine for a first pass, but it’s explicitly noted as a limitation.

The rest mirrors the MLP:
- same time split by train_split_date
- same StandardScaler on features
- MSE loss, Adam optimizer
- OOS scores written to CSV

### 3.4 XGBoost (tree-based nonlinear model)

Implementation: run_xgb_model(data_path, output_path)
- Hyperparameters come from config['models']['xgb']:
- n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, etc.
- Train / test split is again controlled by models.train_split_date.

Pipeline:
1. Load panel CSV, parse date.
2. train_df = df[df['date'] < train_split_date].dropna()
3. test_df = df[df['date'] >= train_split_date].copy()
4. Fit xgb.XGBRegressor on (train_df[factor_cols], train_df['fwd_ret']).
5. Predict on test_df[factor_cols] and write score + fwd_ret to CSV.

## 4. Backtest & evaluation

Given a signals file, the backtest:
1. For each day, ranks stocks by score.
2. Goes long the top quantile and short the bottom quantile (equal weight within legs).
3. Applies a transaction cost proportional to turnover.
4. Produces a daily PnL series and turnover for each model:

src/summary_backtest.py aggregates these into a summary table

## 5. Robustness & alpha ablation
1. Factor-group ablation
- Tag factors as value / momentum / quality / technical.
- Retrain XGBoost while dropping one group at a time.
- Measure ΔSharpe, ΔMDD, and Δturnover.
- Goal: identify which factor groups actually carry edge vs redundancy/noise.
2. Noise tests
- Add noise to factors and labels.
- Increase transaction costs to see how quickly each model breaks.

## 6. Runtime & efficiency
Training time is a constraint in this project. On my actual hardware (single laptop, full 2016–2026 history, daily S&P 500 universe), the wall-clock looks like:
- **Linear IC baseline:** fast (seconds)  
- **XGBoost:** on the order of minutes for a full train + OOS prediction run  
- **MLP:** ~3 hours per full train on the full sample  
- **Transformer:** ~12 hours per full train on the full sample  

A few important consequences:
- **Neural models are expensive here.**  
  With the current configuration, a single Transformer run is ~4× slower than the MLP and massively slower than XGBoost, while delivering **worse Sharpe** than XGBoost.

- **XGBoost hits the best accuracy / compute trade-off.**  
  It gives the strongest out-of-sample performance in this setup while being cheap enough to re-run for robustness and ablation experiments.

- **Experiment design is compute-limited.**  
  Because the neural models take hours, most robustness and alpha ablation work is run on XGBoost (and sometimes the linear baseline), **by design**: that’s where you can realistically afford many variants.

## 7. RL & graph-based extensions (research direction)

This repo is the base for two “next-step” research directions:
### 7.1 RL on top of signals
Prototype code sets up:
- State: factor/signal vector for a given (date, ticker) or portfolio.
- Action: discrete position (short, flat, long) or discretized size.
- Reward: after-cost PnL.

Baseline comparison:
- Simple rule-based threshold strategies vs DQN policies.
- Key questions:
	- Can RL reduce drawdowns or turnover while preserving edge?
 	- Does it adapt better to regime changes than fixed rules?
### 7.2 From trees to graphs (stock networks)
XGBoost winning in the first experiment suggests that structure and nonlinear interactions matter.
The next step is to add structure to the universe itself:
- Build a stock graph:
	- nodes = tickers
	- edges = sector relationships, correlation clusters, co-movement, etc.
 - Plug a GNN into the same pipeline to output score per stock.
